         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving heard what Colonel <hi>Whalley</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to the Honourable Houſe of Commons, concerning the Kings gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving (and withdrawing) of his Word, for his not leaving the Army with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their conſent, hath had doubtfull interpretations, I have thought it my duty to ſet down unto you plainly the matter of fact, to the end, that all the world may ſee how free His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:161329:3"/> is from having done any thing againſt His promiſe, it being my particular duty ſo to do, becauſe I was the occaſion that drew on His Majeſties engagement.</p>
            <p>Soon after I came to wait on His Majeſty at <hi>Woo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne,</hi> Colonel <hi>Whalley</hi> came to me, as he ſaid, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand from the Army, to deſire that I would give my Word, that His Majeſty would not depart from them, without their conſent: To which I reply'd, that I was willing to give my Word accordingly, untill I ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract the ſame. For at that time, and long after, the King was ſo civilly uſed by the Army, that I was confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent the King would not diſavow me in it. In which I found I was not deceived; For as ſoon as I had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted His Majeſty therewith, He was pleaſed imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly to ſend for Colonel <hi>Whalley,</hi> and having enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of him, what paſſed between him and me, His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty ſaid to the Colonel, that He did willingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the engagement which I had made. Of which there was never more queſtion, untill many weeks after His Majeſty came to <hi>Hampton-Court.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the differences of the Army grew great, and an active and powerfull Party thereof daily menacing vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to His Majeſties perſon, His Majeſty commanded me to retract the Engagement, which I had formerly given, alleaging that Colonel <hi>Whalley</hi> affirmed to him, that the Officers of the Army had ſo little power to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Him, as that they were ſcarce able to keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from affronts.</p>
            <p>Whereupon, having found Colonel <hi>Whalley</hi> walking by the River ſide neer <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> I told him, That I came to withdraw that Word, which I had given him,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:161329:3"/> for His Majeſties not leaving the Army, without their conſent.</p>
            <p>The Colonel ſaid, Why then the King doth ſo too: and I told him, you are to underſtand it ſo. He added it was very fairly done, and he would take notice of it accordingly.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, asking the reaſons why I did this; I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, I found there was now no other language ſpoken in Court, but Scotch; and that there was a Party in the Army that began to run to all extremities. That though I was confident, His Majeſty would never ſtir from them willingly; yet He might be forced away, and I was not willing to hazard my Honour, nor my Life, neither for Scot, nor Adjutator.</p>
            <p>And to ſhew you that Colonel <hi>Whalley</hi> rightly appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended what I meant, he ſoon after went to the Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quarter, where he declared unto them, (as I am credibly informed) That the King and my ſelf, had withdrawn our Words, and therefore deſired that ſtricter Guards might be put about His Majeſty, which was done accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.</p>
            <p>And further to ſhew you, That the Colonel himſelf, made no queſtion that the King had retracted His Word, it will clearly appear by this, as His Majeſty was pleaſed to aſſure me: When His Majeſties Children came to <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> the ſtrict Guards which were newly ſet about His Majeſties perſon, behaved themſelves ſo rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they much troubled the Princeſſe. Of which ſhe complaining to the King, He call'd Colonel <hi>Whalley</hi> unto Him, and bade him take order, that his Guards ſhould no more perturb His Childrens reſt. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:161329:4"/> he ſmilingly anſwered, That if His Majeſty would re-ingage Himſelf, He ſhould have no more Guards than formerly. But His Majeſty told him, that He would not, untill the Army gave Him good reaſon ſo to do: For He held it a point of Honour, not to be engaged to thoſe, who had uſed Him ſo harſhly, as they had done of late.</p>
            <p>And therefore the King ſaid, He did not ſpeak to him to remove the Guards, but onely that His Children might take their reſt, when they came to ſee Him.</p>
            <p>Whereupon, Colonel <hi>Whalley</hi> promiſed that he would give ſtrict commands accordingly.</p>
            <p>Colonel <hi>Whalley</hi> likewiſe ſpake to Maſter <hi>Legg</hi> of His Majeſties Bed-chamber, ſaying, That the King found fault with the diſturbance which the Guards gave; and that if the King would re-ingage himſelf, the Guards ſhould be taken off.</p>
            <p>To which Maſter <hi>Legg</hi> replied nothing at that time; but after told him, That he would be an humble ſuitor to His Majeſty to re-ingage Himſelf, ſo that he could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure from the Army, the re-admittance of all His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Attendance lately forbidden the Court, and that there might be no more Guards upon Him than for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly.</p>
            <p>Which the Colonel declined, ſaying, That it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that thoſe Guards ſhould remain, for the ſecurity of His Majeſties perſon. Which paſſage I have received from Maſter <hi>Legg.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides theſe I could give more inſtances, as Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>Whalley's</hi> deſiring His Majeſty to forbeare riding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, immediately upon the withdrawing of His
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:161329:4"/> Word, &amp;c. But I hope theſe may ſerve, to ſhew the clearneſſe of His Majeſties diſ-ingagement. And truly had I not been fully ſatisfied that His Majeſty was free from that engagement, ſuch is my tenderneſſe of His Majeſties honour, that I ſhould not very willingly (though at all times ready, according to my duty, to uſe my beſt endevours for the preſervation of His Majeſties life) have waited on him at this time.</p>
            <p>Sir, I hope this will find no leſſe credit with you, and all men, then there is truth in this Relation, which is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferd to you by</p>
